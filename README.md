## Nota Bene regarding the category reports

Please note that the data displayed by these reports may not be totally accurate for the following reasons:

*   A product can be moved to a different category after an order has been placed.
*   A category can be deleted.
*   A product can be in more than one category.

Thus, if a product is in several categories, it will be counted as a sale for all of these categories.
